<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
  I'm a versatile Software Engineer with <strong>2 years</strong> of experience spanning applied
  AI engineering, business development, and full-stack product delivery. I
  recently completed an AI Internship at PanaceaLogics, where I architected
  cloud and offline AI interviewer platforms (OpenAI + Ollama + Faster Whisper),
  leveraging client strategy and product execution experience. My technical
  focus includes modular AI Interviewer systems, privacy-first offline variants,
  and production-quality React dashboards, automation utilities, and
  visualization tools.

  My experience covers internships and roles at PanaceaLogics, CartKit,
  StackExpert, and R Technologies—translating market and user needs into lean,
  testable product increments. My strengths span Streamlit & LLM integration,
  React & React Native, modular architecture, AI prompt engineering, automation,
  data visualization, workflow optimization, and cross-functional communication.
