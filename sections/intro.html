<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
  I have practical experience in NOC and networking, with a strong foundation in
  Cisco CCNA concepts including OSI Model, TCP/IP Stack, IPv4/IPv6, subnetting,
  VLANs, routing, NAT, ACLs, WAN, wireless, and security. I have completed Cisco
  Packet Tracer labs covering router and switch configuration, troubleshooting,
  VLANs, routing protocols, DHCP, HSRP, STP, and EtherChannel.

<p>
  My skills include network monitoring and troubleshooting using SolarWinds,
  Grafana, SNMP, and Syslog. I am experienced in network performance analysis,
  dashboard visualization, and metrics tracking. I have worked with static and
  dynamic routing (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP), Layer 2/3 switching, network topology
  design (campus LAN, spine-leaf, WAN), incident response, and connectivity
  troubleshooting.

<p>
  I am familiar with LAN/WAN configuration (VPN, MPLS, PPPoE, leased lines),
  firewall and security concepts (ACLs, port security, DHCP snooping, DAI,
  IDS/IPS, cryptography), device management (Cisco IOS, Syslog, SNMP, SSH, AAA),
  quality of service (QoS), cloud networking fundamentals, wireless networking
  (WLC, CAPWAP, radio frequencies, security), and network automation and
  programmability (APIs, Ansible, SDN, model-driven programmability).
