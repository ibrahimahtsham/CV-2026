<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
  I am a NOC (Network Operations Center) Engineer with practical experience in
  network monitoring, troubleshooting, and incident response. I have worked with
  Cisco, Juniper, and Fortinet devices, using tools like SolarWinds, Nagios, and
  Zabbix to monitor enterprise networks and respond to alerts. My
  responsibilities have included supporting network infrastructure, analyzing
  traffic patterns, documenting technical issues, and collaborating with teams
  to resolve outages and connectivity problems.

  I have hands-on experience with network automation, real-time alert
  management, and technical documentation. My strengths include root cause
  analysis, escalation management, and clear communication with stakeholders and
  technical teams.
